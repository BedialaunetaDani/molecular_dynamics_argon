# Weekly progress journal

## Instructions

In this journal you will document your progress of the project, making use of the weekly milestones.

Every week you should 

1. write down **on the day of the lecture** a short plan (bullet list is sufficient) of how you want to 
   reach the weekly milestones. Think about how to distribute work in the group, 
   what pieces of code functionality need to be implemented.
2. write about your progress **until Monday, 23:59** before the next lecture with respect to the milestones.
   Substantiate your progress with links to code, pictures or test results. Reflect on the
   relation to your original plan.

We will give feedback on your progress on Tuesday before the following lecture. Consult the 
[grading scheme](https://computationalphysics.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/proj1-moldyn-grading/) 
for details how the journal enters your grade.

Note that the file format of the journal is *markdown*. This is a flexible and easy method of 
converting text to HTML. 
Documentation of the syntax of markdown can be found 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gfm-extends-standard-markdown). 
You will find how to include [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links) and 
[images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#images) particularly
useful.

## Week 1

**Bullet List**
- Write `main.py` with some basic working code. This includes:
   - Write the numerical constants for the simulation.
   - Initializing uniformly random velocity and position.
   - Calculate relative position and relative distance matrices for the LJ force.
   - Iterate over time, simulating the velocities and positions using Euler method.
   - Every iteration, check if particles are outside of domain to fulfill periodic boundary conditions (if so, displace them accordingly).
   - Calculate energy to check if it is conserved along time.
- Once code works, divide it in function blocks (and use `skeleton.py` as template for the functions)
